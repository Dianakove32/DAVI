                    <b> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for documents
                    designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                    documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                    and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                    objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.

                            plain text, but with a formatting element and tags are applied. The general syntax for
                            writing tags is as follows.
                        </p>
                        <p> Tags are of two types - single and paired (containers). A single tag is used on its own,
                            while a paired tag can include other tags or text within it. Tags are allowed different
                            attributes, which are separated by a space. However, there are tags without any additional
                            attributes. Attributes can be conventionally divided into mandatory, they must be present,
                            and optional, their addition depends on the purpose of the tag.

                            their values, as a rule, can be grouped by different types, for example, specifying color,
                            size, address, etc. Next, we will consider the main types of values.</p>

                            Any number of consecutive spaces, displayed in the browser as one.

                            No matter how many spaces you put between words, it will not affect the final appearance of
                            the text. The same rule applies to tabs and text wrapping. Therefore, do not add extra
                            spaces, as this will only increase the total file size, but will not change the way the
                            document looks in the browser.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The exception to this rule is the pre tag, within which any number of spaces are displayed
                            exactly as specified in the code.

                        <p>
                            HTML does not support word hyphenation, as text editors do, in other words, all words are
                            written entirely without breaking them. This condition is irrelevant until the text is
                            justified. In this case, the block of text is left and right aligned. At the same time,
                            short lines are stretched by automatically adding spaces between words. Sometimes the blank
                            blocks between words are so large that they spoil the appearance of the page and impair the
                            readability of the text.

                        <p>
                            Imagine that you have a long word in the middle of a sentence, like
                            "Dehydroepiandrosterone". In a text editor, this word will be wrapped by syllables so that
                            the text takes up the specified width, and on a web page such a word will be displayed in
                            its entirety, without hyphenation.

                            If you just write one long line in the HTML code, it will be formatted in the browser so
                            that the text fits the width of the window. Text hyphenation will be added automatically at
                            spaces or hyphens. What happens if there is neither one nor the other character in the text?
                            The browser will not be able to create hyphenations and will display the text in one line.
                            If it is wider than the browser window, then a horizontal scroll bar will inevitably appear.

                            Links are the backbone of hypertext documents and allow you to navigate from one web page to
                            another. Their peculiarity is that the link itself can lead not only to HTML files, but also
                            to a file of any type, and this file can be placed on a completely different site. The main
                            thing is that the referenced document has access. In other words, if the path to the file
                            can be specified in the address bar of the browser, and the file will be opened, then a link
                            can be made to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To create a link, you must tell the browser what the link is, and also indicate the address
                            of the document to which the link should be made. Both actions are performed using the a
                            tag.

                        <p>
                            The href attribute defines a URL (Universal Resource Locator), in other words, the address
                            of the document to navigate to, and the contents of container a> are a link. The text
                            between the a> and / a> tags is blue and underlined by default.

                            If a link is specified to a file that does not exist, for example, its name in the href
                            attribute is typed with an error, then such a link is called broken. Broken links should be
                            strictly avoided as they mislead website visitors.

                            their performance and immediately eliminate the existing errors.

                            A linked file opens in a browser window only if the browser knows the type of document.
                            However, since the link can be made to any type of file, the browser cannot always display
                            the document. This displays a message on how to process the file - open it or save it to the
                            specified folder.

                            An anchor is a bookmark with a unique name at a specific place on a web page, designed to
                            create a link to it. It is convenient to use anchors in large documents so that you can
                            quickly jump to the desired section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To create an anchor, you must first make a bookmark in the appropriate place and give it a
                            name using the name attribute of the a> tag
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One feature of the browser is associated with anchors. After moving to the specified anchor,
                            pressing the "Back" button returns not to the previous viewed page, but to the link from
                            which the transition to the anchor was made. It turns out that to go to the previous
                            document, you need to press the "Back" button two times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The link can also be made to a bookmark located on another web page or even another site. To
                            do this, in the href attribute of the a> tag, you must specify the address of the document
                            and at the end add the hash symbol # and the bookmark name
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the web page contains a link to an anchor, but the anchor itself is not, then no error
                            will occur.

                            Adding an image takes place in two stages: first, a graphic file of the desired size is
                            prepared, then it is added to the page via the img> tag. The HTML itself is intended only to
                            display the required image, without changing it in any way.

                                displayed.</ol>
                            <ol>The size of the picture must be limited in width, for example, set no more than 800

                            Due to the versatility of tables, a large number of parameters that control their
                            appearance, tables have long become a definite standard for the layout of web pages. A table
                            with an invisible border is like a modular grid, in which blocks it is convenient to place
                            elements of a web page. However, this is not quite the right approach, because each HTML
                            object is defined for its own purposes and if it is used for other purposes, and moreover,
                            it means that there are no alternatives. This was the case for a long time, until layers
                            came to replace tables in site layout. This does not mean that layers are now used all the
                            time, but the trend has already been clearly outlined - tables are used to place tabular
                            data, and layers - for layout and design.

                            A table consists of rows and columns of cells that can contain text and pictures. Typically,
                            tables are used to organize and present data, but tables are not limited to that. With the
                            help of tables, it is convenient to typeset page layouts by arranging fragments of text and
                            images in the desired way.

                        <p>
                            The table> tag is used to add a table to a web page. This element serves as a container for
                            elements that define the contents of the table. Any table consists of rows and cells, which
                            are specified using the tr> and td> tags, respectively. The table must contain at least one
                            cell. It is allowed to use the th> tag instead of the td> tag. The text in a cell decorated
                            with the th> tag is rendered in bold by the browser and aligned to the center of the cell.
                            Otherwise, there is no difference between the cells created via the td> and th> tags.

                            Frames divide the browser window into separate areas that sit side by side. A separate web
                            page is loaded into each of these areas. Since there is a lot of talk around frames about
                            their need, here are the advantages and disadvantages of frames so that you can
                            independently decide whether to use them on your site.

                        Frames delimit a web page into two areas that contain the site's navigation and content. The
                        frame mechanism allows you to open a document in one frame by clicking a link in a completely
                        different frame. This division of a web page into components is intuitive and logical.

                        <p>
                            <b>Rapidity.</b>

                            For a layout without frames, it is common to place both navigation and content on one page.
                            This increases the volume of each page and, in total, can significantly affect the amount of
                            information downloaded from the site. And since frames use the division of information into
                            parts, pages with them will load faster.

                            Frames provide a unique opportunity - placing information exactly in the right place in the
                            browser window. So, you can put a frame at the bottom of the browser and regardless of the
                            scrolling of the content, this area will not change its position.

                            The web page is loaded only into the specified window, the rest remain unchanged. Using
                            JavaScript, you can simultaneously load two or more pages into frames
                        </p>
                        <b>Disadvantages of frames</b>

                        <p> <b>Navigation</b>

                            The user often finds himself on the site, completely unaware of where he got to, because he
                            just clicked on the link received in the search engine. To make it easier for a site visitor
                            to figure out where he is, the site name, page title, and navigation are placed on each
                            page. Frames tend to violate this principle by separating the site title from the content,
                            and the navigation from the content. Imagine that you find a suitable link in a search
                            engine, click on it, and as a result, a document opens without a title and navigation. To
                            understand where we are or to look at other materials, you will have to edit the path in the
                            address bar, which is inconvenient anyway.

                            Search engines do not work well with framing because the pages that contain the content do
                            not have links to other documents.

                            Frames hide the URL of the page the visitor is on and always show only the URL of the site.
                            For this reason, the page you like is difficult to bookmark your browser.

                        <p> <b>Incompatibility with different browsers</b>

                            Frame parameters have the property of displaying completely differently in different
                            browsers. Moreover, the contradiction between them is so obvious that the same parameters
                            are interpreted by browsers in their own way.
                        </p>
                        <p> <b>Disrespect</b></p>

                        <p>
                            A very strange flaw that has nothing to do with the technical features of creating a site,
                            but rather an ideological one. Sites with frames are considered undignified, and their
                            authors immediately fall out of the category of professionals who never use frames in their
                            work. The exception is chats, where you can do without frames, although it is possible, but
                            rather tricky methods, and with the help of frames, creating chats is quite simple.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It should be noted that some of the above disadvantages are completely bypassed. So, with
                            the help of scripts, you can make a separate document opened in the browser formed with the
                            entire frame structure. Search engines are also already better at indexing frame documents
                            than they were a few years ago.

                            Validation will mean checking a document for compliance with web standards and identifying
                            existing errors. Accordingly, a web document that has gone through a similar procedure and
                            has no comments on the code is valid. The code of a web page must obey certain rules called
                            a specification, which is developed by the W3 Consortium (www.w3c.org) with the support of
                            the browser developers.

                        <p>
                            At first glance, it seems that validation is necessary, because we are talking about
                            reducing the number of developers' mistakes and writing "correct" code. In fact, everything
                            is much more complicated, and around validation there is still heated debate about its
                            relevance. In order to objectively reveal this issue, we will further consider the pros and
                            cons of such a check.

                            <b> Pros of validation</b>

                            Although HTML code has a fairly simple hierarchical structure, it is easy to get confused in
                            the code as the size of the document grows, therefore, it is easy to make a mistake.
                            Browsers, despite obviously incorrect code, will try to render the web page anyway. But
                            since there is no single regulation on how a "crooked" document should be displayed, each
                            browser tries to do it differently. And this, in turn, leads to the fact that the same
                            document may look different in popular browsers. Correction of obvious mistakes and
                            systematization of the code leads, as a rule, to a stable result.

                            <b> Trends</b>

                            The days when browser makers added unique features to their product contrary to all
                            standards are starting to fade into the past. Each new version of the browser increasingly
                            supports specifications and displays documents with minimal or no errors. Developers of
                            sites that also adhere to the canons of web standards, thus comply with modern trends in the
                            development of web technologies.

                        <p>
                            Don't forget about XML (eXtensible Markup Language). This language is becoming the de facto
                            standard for storing data and exchanging information between different applications. XML
                            syntax is stricter than HTML and does not forgive the slightest mistakes. In a sense, XML is
                            like programming languages in which the program won't compile until the code is debugged.
                            HTML is the first step to learning XML, so by accustoming yourself to write code according
                            to all the rules, it will be easier to move to the next stage of HTML development.

                            <b>Indirect benefits</b>

                            Compliance with standards provides many benefits, which show up in the smallest detail and
                            become visible when a certain critical mass is reached. In particular, the amount of code
                            becomes smaller, more compact, and more readable. Accordingly, the loading speed of the site
                            as a whole increases for users.

                            <b>Cons of validation</b>

                            Sites, of course, are made so that people visit them. It is the visitors who are the measure
                            of the site's work, and they are interested in information and the way to obtain it. The
                            user wants the site to display correctly in his favorite browser, load quickly and contain
                            the materials he needs. Note that there is nothing in this list about the document code and
                            its validity, visitors are simply not interested. Therefore, a completely invalid site, but
                            made with soul, filled with interesting materials will attract more visitors than an empty
                            resource, but made according to all the "rules".

                        <p>
                            <b>Browsers</b>

                            Browser developers do not always follow the specification and in some cases interpret the
                            code not according to the given rules, but in their own way. Ultimately, this leads to the
                            fact that a web page that is displayed correctly (that is, as intended by the developers) in
                            one browser is displayed with errors in another. Following the specification in such cases
                            is likely to scare off some browser users. For example, Internet Explorer (IE) currently
                            holds the leading position among browsers, but it supports the HTML and CSS specification
                            worse than Firefox and Opera. Obviously, IE users, when visiting a site made according to
                            all standards, but not taking into account the specifics of this browser, will see an
                            unsightly picture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Site customers, as well as their developers, do not like this situation, so when faced with
                            a choice: standards or a browser, they mostly choose a browser.
                        </p>
                        It turns out a disappointing picture - there is no particular need to spend time debugging the
                        code to comply with the specification. It is better to devote this time to making the document
                        work without problems in different browsers - this is how web developers mostly think.

                        <b>Summary</b>

                        So is it worth validating documents and doing this step when writing web pages? Definitely yes.
                        It will help someone to identify the existing shortcomings, to others it will help to write
                        correct code. Fixing errors, achieving full compliance with standards, or leaving them for the
                        sake of compatibility with different browsers - here everyone decides for himself what goals he
                        pursues and what is more important for him.
